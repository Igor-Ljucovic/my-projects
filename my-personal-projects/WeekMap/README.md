Note: At the time of recording, I only had two front-end tests (register and activity category). 
I may add more in the future, they would work in the same way.

Note: I used this project to learn technologies I often saw other developers talking about. 
After seeing Selenium and PowerShell, I got inspired and just had to turn my idea into reality.
