-A boss rush prototype game similar to an already existing one
(Hollow Knight) where the player can choose items, a game mode
and a boss to fight from the menu.




Currently has 2 game modes:

1. Classic - same controls and abilities as in the original Hollow Knight

-jump, double jump, wall slide, wall jump, dash
-3 spells from the original
-12 items (charms) to choose from in the menu before the boss


2. Ultimate - a couple of additional movement abilities

-everything in classic + fast fall, spot dodge, air dodge, roll
-3 spells from the original
-12 new items (charms) to choose from in the menu before the boss

Currently has 1 boss with 4 phases and 10 attacks.

Currently has 3 arenas.

Has an input buffer system for better user experience
(for example, if the player presses the attack button twice in quick
succession, even though the attack was on cooldown when the attack
button was pressed the second time, the player will still perform
the attack exactly when the attack cooldown is over, because of the
buffer system, instead of the second attack never happening).
