A Client-server C# WinForms Desktop application 
for managing hotels, reviews, guests, rooms and reservations.

While building this project, I learned about using client-server software architecture without using a framework, 
using a database broker, controllers, Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS), UML database diagrams,
sockets, threads, JSON serialization, using just the right amount of abstraction.
