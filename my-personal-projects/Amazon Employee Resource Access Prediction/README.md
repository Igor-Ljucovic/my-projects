**Amazon employee resource access prediction | Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Numpy**

-Developed machine learning classification models to predict 
whether an employee should be granted access to a resource. 
Wrote a detailed report about them. Achieved ROC-AUC of 0.88

-"_Jupyter analysis.ipynb" file is a detailed Jupyter file report of the entire process
of implementing the machine learning models (preprocessing, creating models, evaluation)

-"_Report.pdf" file is a 5 page summary of this project and what it has accomplished 


Note: I Used this project to learn more about Python and its machine learning and data science
libraries by building and evaluating predictive models
