**JobSwap | React Native, Firebase**

-A mobile app for Android & iOS that helps users meet each other and message about 
swapping local jobs based on location and matching settings

-This app is useful, for example, if two students work similar or the same jobs on opposite sides of the city from where they live. 
They can message each other to see if they can swap jobs, since it would be more efficient for both to work at a place much closer to their home.

as well as and how to work with device's location and notifications
