PERSONAL PROJECTS
Fully functional applications I’ve built to learn new tech. 
These range from a React + Laravel nutrition web app, to a C# hotel forms application, 
a Unity game inspired by Hollow Knight, or even automation scripts in Python.
I might or might not be working on some of these apps at the moment,
if i left a YouTube link to preview the app, that means that the app
is at least ready for use.

SANDBOX - Random experiments and "just for fun" coding. 
For example, I'd wake up and think if there is actually consistent ways
of solving sudokus, then I'd try to implement it as a method, or 
I would try to make a method for some sort of math problem using recursion.
It’s also a good place to see how I like to structure my code.
